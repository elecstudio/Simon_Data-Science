# Mini Project 1

In this project our goal is to draw sketch on our webcam. 

## Procedures
1. Read an image (in our case a frame)
2. Convert into a grayscale
3. Remove noise using *Gaussian blur*
4. Detect edges using Canny Edge Detection (feel free to adjust lower and upper threshold values to get better result)
5. Apply Binary Inverse Threshold as if it looks like a sketch (as an optional we can do a bitwise not operator)
6. Run the program and turn on our webcam to see if it works
